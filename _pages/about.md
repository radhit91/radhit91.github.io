I recently worked(till June 2020) as a software development intern at NK Securities, a High Frequency Trading firm based in Gurgaon, India. My role as an intern was to analyze shortfalls in the current trading infrastructure, devise potential solutions and finally, put it to use by developing low-latency improvisions. The tenure of my internship was six months. At the end of it, I made some significant contributions in mitigating the overall end-to-end delay from stock exchange to our trading server and back.

I, recently, graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur. Initially, I was enrolled in Electrical Engineering for a four year B.Tech program starting in 2015. At the end of my second year, I applied for a second major in Computer Science and successfully got an opportunity to complete it. As a result, my undergraduate duration was increased to five years. But, my inquisitiveness of exploring my majors in depth led me to overload semesters which in turn helped me finish the required coursework of both majors one semester ahead of the intended time duration. Thus, the adventurous journey of undergraduation at IIT Kanpur ended after four and a half years in December, 2019. 

During the summer of 2017, I was awarded SURGE(Students' Undergraduate Research Graduate Excellence) Fellowship to work on the project "Robust Feature Extraction using Autoencoders" for eight weeks. My task was to design an autoencoder to retrive uncorrelated, statistically significant features from a Lung Cancer Dataset. My first industry experience was at Adobe Systems in 2018. I worked there for three months as a Research Intern with two fellow interns on the project "Landmark Conditioned Image Generation using GANs" which dealt with synthethic image generation from Generative Adversarial Networks using heatmap encoded facial landmarks as the only input. We managed to generate images that had facial landmarks within five pixels of the expected location with very high probability.

Apart from academics, my hobbies include cricket and chess. Cricket has emerged as a new religion in India and I am a devout follower of it. Chess has its origins in India where it used to be a royal game played by rival kings. The reason for my penchant for chess is its analogy with the real life. Life is nothing but a game of chess where you have to play your best move in a state defined by nature. I would like to end with an interesting quote from Dr. Richard Feynman, "The present situation in physics is as if we know chess, but we donâ€™t know one or two rules."
